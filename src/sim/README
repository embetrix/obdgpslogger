OBD Simulator for OBD GPS Logger


At time of writing, this simulator honors the AT commands:
E{0,1} - Echo on or off
S{0,1} - Spaces on or off
H{0,1} - Headers on or off [recognises but not honors, currently]
Z - reset

I have massacred his code beyond recognition for this module in
obdgpslogger, so I cannot point to individual parts that are necessarily
copyright Michael as opposed to me - please consider anything in this
module to be copyrighted code by both Michael Carpenter and myself.

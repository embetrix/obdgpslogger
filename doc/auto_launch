There's a couple different things in obdgpslogger to make it easy to
use in an auto-launch-when-you-plug-it-in kind of way:

1) Modify the config file /etc/obdgpslogger to point the logfile where
you'd like to save it, probably on removable media. eg

log_file=/media/usbthumb/carlog.db


2a) If your system has the ftdi kernel module [ie, regular Linux boxes]

Add a rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/40-ftdi.rules to launch obdgpslogger

ACTION=="add", BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/obdgpslogger -s /dev/%k"

If you have an OBDLink or other device that defaults to 38400 baud
instead of 9600, then add a line to /etc/obdgpslogger:

baudrate=38400


2b) If your system does not have the ftdi kernel module [eg, a SheevaPlug]

Create a shell script in /usr/local/bin called "obd_ftdilaunch.sh":

#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/obdftdipty -cdb 38400
# If your device defaults to 9600 baud, just use "-cd"
exec /usr/local/bin/obdgpslogger

And add a rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/40-ftdi.rules to launch that script instead:

ACTION=="add", BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", RUN+="/usr/local/bin/obd_ftdilaunch.sh"

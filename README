OBDII/GPS Logging Tool


What?

Your car has lots of interesting things it can tell you from the
on-board computer while it's running. obdlogger is a small tool to grab
data from an OBDII device and log it to an sqlite database.
If you enable it [on by default, and a large part of this project's
point], then your gps position is also logged to the same database.


How do I build this?

Binaries are placed in the "bin" subdir of the top level directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # or ccmake .. to edit options
make
make install


And how do I run it?

./obdlogger [-s serialport] [-d sqlite database]
./obd2kml [-d sqlite database]
More specific information is availble in --help or man pages

OBDII/GPS Logging Tool


What?

Your car has lots of interesting things it can tell you from the
on-board computer while it's running. obdlogger is a small tool to grab
data from an OBDII device and log it to an sqlite database.
If you enable it [on by default, and a large part of this project's
point], then your gps position is also logged to the same database.


How do I build this?

Binaries are placed in the "bin" subdir of the top level directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

"make distclean" in this scenario is equivalent to "rm -rf bin build"
Disable gpsd by using ccmake [instead of cmake], and turn off ENABLE_GPSD


And how do I run it?

./obdlogger [-s serialport path] [-d sqlite database name]


What if I want different data?

Edit obdservicecommands.h, and change the db_column field to something
human readable on any fields you wish to log

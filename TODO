obdgpslogger:

Configuration file
 - serial port for OBD device
 - serial port for GPS device
 - any other parameters?

Trouble codes?

Option to log all serial port communications to a file for debugging.

Optimisations:
 - Change --enable-optimisations to take a version number or allow
     granular control?
 - ATBRD08 to run at 500k on CAN bus
 - ATCRA/ATCM & ATCF to make sure only engine ecu is replying


obd2kml:

Add more graphs? What's useful?

Fix progress reporting while drawing individual graphs

Add timestamps to graphs, so google earth can animate appropraitely.


obdgui:

Better shortcuts. Alt-F4/Apple-Q/Ctrl-Q should quit. Probably not escape.


obd2osm:

OpenStreetMap possibilities:

1) Doing stuff the "right" [ish] way
Download multiple .osm segments to encompass the whole area of a trip
 http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.5/map?bbox=-0.5,51.3,-0.4,51.4
 bbox params are WEST, SOUTH, EAST, NORTH

Export trip data as a .osm file if can figure out how to render an
overlay using it. Just marking stuff as "road" won't work.

This bit may not be necessary if osmarender lets you have different
rules with different files:
Use Osmosis to combine .osm segments and trip .osm file into single .osm file
 http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis
 osmosis --rx file2.osm --rx file1.osm --m --wx merged.osm

Use osmarender to render .osm file to useful output
 http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmarender

2) Still working off raw OSM data
Same as #1, but use osmarender to create tiles then draw overlay ourselves
using, eg, imagemagick or libsvg or something.

3) Piggyback someone else for all the hard stuff
Download rendered tiles from openstreetmap directly, overlay our trace
on top of it, using general purpose image editing libraries

Might be a bad idea, since you're mostly borrowing bandwidth from
OSM. On the plus side, it'd be easy.

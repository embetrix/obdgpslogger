Add more graphs? What's useful?


obd2osm: OpenStreetMap possibilities:

1) Doing stuff the "right" [ish] way
Download multiple .osm segments to encompass the whole area of a trip
 http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.5/map?bbox=-0.5,51.3,-0.4,51.4
 bbox params are WEST, SOUTH, EAST, NORTH

Export trip data as a .osm file

This bit may not be necessary if osmarender lets you have different
rules with different files:
Use Osmosis to combine .osm segments and trip .osm file into single .osm file
 http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis
 osmosis --rx file2.osm --rx file1.osm --m --wx merged.osm

Use osmarender to render .osm file to useful output
 http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmarender

2) Still working off raw OSM data
Same as #1, but use osmarender to create tiles then draw overlay ourselves
using, eg, imagemagick or libsvg or something.

3) Piggyback someone else for all the hard stuff
Download rendered tiles from openstreetmap directly, overlay our trace
on top of it, using general purpose image editing libraries

Might be a bad idea, since you're mostly borrowing bandwidth from
OSM. On the plus side,
